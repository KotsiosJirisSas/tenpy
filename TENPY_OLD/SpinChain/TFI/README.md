FOR FINITE DMRG FOR WHATEVER REASON THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SSB PART OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM (LOOK AT ord_params_f.png). BUT, SOMEHOW GS ENERGY STILL MATCHES THE EXACT ONE... 

USING LONGER CHAINS FIXES THIS. EG FOR A CHAIN OF L=80 MOST OF THE SSB PART OF THE PHASE DIAGRAM IS REPRODUCED (LOOK AT ord_params_f_80_sites.png)
