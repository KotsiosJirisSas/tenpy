- :issue:`443` document default model coupling parameters explicitly in docstrings
- Allow `None` value in :cfg:option:`Sweep.chi_list` which is to be replaced by ``trunc_params['chi_max']`` at class initialization.
- Handle SIGINT signal during simulation runs to continue until next algorithm checkpoint, save and then exit "gracefully" by raising KeyboardInterrupt.
  See :meth:`~tenpy.simulations.Simulation.handle_abort_signal`.

- go back to original dir after finishing a simulation (end of context manager) such that relative 'directory' options work as expected when repeatedly running simulations

- move `tenpy.algorithms.truncation` module to `tenpy.linalg.truncation`.
  

- Fix: When saving simulation results, convert list from `update_stats` and `sweep_stats` into numpy arrays.
  This can significantly reduce saving time and the size of the resulting hdf5 file - we have seen the size go down from 30MB to 700kB, when no psi and environment were saved!
- Fix: :class:`~tenpy.algorithms.tdvp.TwoSiteTDVP` wasn't using the `start_trunc_err` option.
- Fix :issue:`459` that TDVP and VUMPS shouldn't have both `lanczos_params` and `lanczos_options`. 
  Deprecated the name `lanczos_options` (which was the one actually used) for more consistency with other algorithm engines.
